# FC-compiler
The FC-compiler project is a semester project for the course "Theory of Computation" in Technical University of Crete. The main purpose of this project is to create a compiler for the fictional programming language FC (Fictional C) using the open source tools lex (FLEX) and yacc (BISON). The goal here is to give the (FC-)compiler a program written in FC and give us back the corresponding (compiled-translated) program in C programming language.
